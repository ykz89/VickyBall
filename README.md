# VickyBall

Forked from [roBa](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/roBa) which was based on [KeyBall](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball).
The name VickyBall is a combination of [VIK](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik) and [KeyBall](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball).

Changes:
- Use VIK to connect the trackball
- Sacrifice key to make space for a VIK connector (42 keys, or 41 keys and an encoder).
- Use [Sadek](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi)'s switch footprint to support MX, Choc and GLP switches.
