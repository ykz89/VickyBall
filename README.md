# VickyBall

Based on [KeyBall](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball) and [roBa](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/roBa).

This project is forked from [roBa](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/roBa) with the main goal to convert the trackball sensor to use [VIK](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik). The name VickyBall is a combination of [VIK](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik) and [KeyBall](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball).

Full list of changes:
- Sacrifice keys to make space for changes
- Add VIK connectors to trackball module and keyboard
- Change switch footprint to support MX, Choc and GLP switches
- Change microcontroller footprint from Xiao nrf52840 to Xiao nrf52840 Plus
